This repo is the interface repo of the zkBridge Messaging component and mainly contains three files: [IMessaging.sol](./src/interfaces/IMessaging.sol), [Receiver.sol](./src/interfaces/Receiver.sol) and [ReceiverUpgradeable.sol](./src/interfaces/ReceiverUpgradeable.sol). Developers can easily implement cross-chain communication by introducing interface files.
